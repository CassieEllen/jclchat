-G <generator-name>

  CodeBlocks - Ninja           = Generates CodeBlocks project files.
  CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles  = Generates CodeBlocks project files.
  
I could not get the "CodeBlocks - Ninja" generator working, but the other works just fine. I kind of am bouncing back and forth between using emacs/cmake/make and codeblocks. Especially since the latter tends to just die at times w/o any indication why. 

Creates a codeblocks project file

  cd build
  cmake -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" ../src


Creates a backup of the entire project, excluding the build directory.

  tar -czv --exclude='*/build/*' -f chat.tgz jclchat
