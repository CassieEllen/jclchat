On Unix platforms, an application built on top of the ServerApplication class can be optionally run as a daemon by giving the —daemon command line option. A daemon, when launched, immediately forks off a background process that does the actual work. After launching the background process, the foreground process exits. 

When running as a daemon, specifying the —pidfile option (e.g., —pidfile=/var/run/sample.pid) may be useful to record the process ID of the daemon in a file. The PID file will be removed when the daemon process terminates (but not, if it crashes).
